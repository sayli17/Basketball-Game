# Basketball-Game

In this Android app we use the acceleration values from accelerometer sensor to move a basketball on the screen. There are three classes - Main activity class, SimulationView class, and Particle class.

If the ball touches either of the walls of the mobile screen, a bounce effect should be generated.
